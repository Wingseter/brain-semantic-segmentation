# Brain-otoch: AI-Powered Brain Tumor Segmentation and Visualization

![Brain-otoch Logo](path_to_logo_image)

## Overview

**Brain-otoch** is an innovative project that combines AI-powered brain tumor segmentation with interactive visualization using Unity. This project leverages deep learning models to accurately segment brain tumors in MRI scans and uses Unity to create an immersive and interactive visualization experience.

## Features

- **Accurate Tumor Segmentation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art AI models for precise segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Implements Unity to provide a 3D visualization of the segmented tumors, enhancing the interpretability and user experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible and intuitive for medical professionals and researchers.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source project encouraging community collaboration and enhancements.

## Project Structure

- `Model`: Contains the AI model code and related scripts.
- `Application`: Contains the Unity project for visualization and interaction.

## Installation

### Model

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-otoch.git
    cd brain-otoch/Model
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the dataset (link to dataset) and place it in the `data/` directory.

### Application

1. Ensure you have [Unity](https://unity.com/) installed on your system.

2. Open the `Application` folder with Unity Hub or Unity Editor.

## Usage

### Segmentation

To perform brain tumor segmentation, navigate to the `Model` directory and run:
```bash
python segment.py --input data/sample_mri.nii --output results/segmentation_output.nii
```

### Visualization

To visualize the segmentation results in Unity:
1. Export the segmentation output from the `Model` as a compatible file format for Unity.
2. Open the Unity project in the `Application` folder.
3. Load the exported segmentation output into the Unity application for 3D visualization.

## Model Training

To train the model from scratch:
```bash
python train.py --data data/ --epochs 50 --batch-size 16
```
For detailed training options, refer to the [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md) file.

## Visualization

The Unity application provides robust visualization tools:
- **3D Tumor Rendering**: Visualize the segmented tumor in 3D.
- **Interactive Tools**: Rotate, zoom, and manipulate the 3D model for detailed examination.
